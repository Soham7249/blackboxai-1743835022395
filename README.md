# Teacher's Portal

## Project Overview
Teacher's Portal is a comprehensive web application designed for educators to showcase their profiles, courses, testimonials, and facilitate communication with students.

   ```

2. **Open the project in your preferred code editor**.

3. **Open the index.html file** in your browser to view the application. No additional setup is required as the application uses static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
